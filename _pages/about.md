HelloðŸ‘‹ I'm a full-stack developer who likes to build things -- especially anything involving data.

I have a background in mathematics and computer science and currently work as a Software Developer at [SAS Institute](https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html) in Cary, NC. Outside of work, I love to play volleyball, tennis, and snowboard.

This site is where I share my projects and the occasional write-up about things I'm learning along the way.
